        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <p>
        This page will serve as the advertising part of the website. It will serve 
        as the eye-catching convincing part to lure in potential customers. I believe 
        that a good design of a website attracts people to explore and know more about
        the website. As someone who loves design, it creates a strong first impression
        and displays credibility. It will also outshine other competitors of a similar 
        content kind of website as it will incorporate latest trend designs of the year.
        This page will also contain the basic fun facts and all knowledge pertaining to 
        white water rafting. The images will be designed interactively to fit in the fun
        facts written. It will give them information that will help them understand the 
        basic terms as well as instructions for safety procedures. It will also contain 
        some listed benefits of white water rafting to persuade them to try it. The 
        design target are late teens to adults who are able in health and body to face 
        the waves of rafting. It will also have the things they need to bring, requirements 
        to qualify, and safety guidelines for it. All these things will be in this webpage
        but it will be designed in a fun way that it won’t be boring and information overload.  
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>[Booking]</h3>
      <p>
        The booking part of this website will give them the instructions how to book
        a session. They will be able to see the available schedule: any date and time 
        that suits them especially for those who wants to plan ahead. People particularly 
        those who are the target audience of this website are usually busy but they can 
        access this quickly and go on an adventure they will surely enjoy. We can’t afford
        to spoil the excitement by the complication of booking and design. We want this 
        page to be as comprehensible as possible. Sales and promos will also be displayed
        to attract them more into booking bulk sessions that the costumers will surely 
        enjoy. The prices will also be up for display so the customers can decide which 
        amount will fit their budget while having quality adventure. It will require them 
        to enter their email, contact number, and the booking session they chose but it 
        will still include contact details if they want to talk in real-time to book. It 
        is very convenient that bookings can be as easy with just one click they can 
        already avail it without calling or going to the place. The design for this will 
        be simple and efficient but still eye-catching so that they will not get lost 
        while trying to navigate and do the next step for booking. It is also aimed that 
        they can easily cancel or add any sessions anytime to what they have already 
        decided.

      <h3>[About Us & FAQ]</h3>

        This particular page of the website will focus on the information about the 
        creators of the website as well as the professional email address of the 
        white rafting company specifically those who have questions. This is a dual 
        purpose page as well because it will also serve to answer frequently asked 
        questions (FAQ) of customers which will range from additional information 
        about booking, website failures, cancellations, and complaints etc. This 
        website will be open twenty-four (24) hours a day to accommodate any 
        customer and a response will be immediately sent within twelve hours of send. 
        Not only does an FAQ with links to related content provide the user with a 
        deeper experience of your website, it also boosts the internal link-building, 
        which is an important search ranking factor. We are going to keep FAQ answers 
        concise and include links to more in-depth information elsewhere on your site.
