    <h2>MJ</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm MJ from the Philippines and I'm 23 years old. I am pursuing a degree in Applied Technology here in BYU-Idaho. I currently work as an online Engish Teacher for Koreans. I have been a member since 2015 when I was 15 years old. I have served a mission in the Philippines Butuan Mission from June 2019-December 2020. I am a YSA leader as well as Sunday School Teacher for Single Adults in our ward. </p>
    <p>The advancement of technology in these modern times is quite fast. I love technology! It has evolved along with us and has assisted us in various ways to make a lot of tasks easier. I have taken the Web Programming course during my senior highschool years and the same course last semester. Honestly, I really love designing web pages, making useful apps and structuring my codes but I get impatient sometimes when there are errors in the code or the design went awry. On the other hand, the sense of fulfillment is amazing when I see the final outcome. Patience is a virtue.</p>
    <p>I'm happy to meet you all and let's all work together well.</p>
